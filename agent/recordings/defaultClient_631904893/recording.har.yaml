                  Below is the code from file path src/sum.ts. Review the code
                  outside the XML tags to detect the functionality, formats,
                  style, patterns, and logics in use. Then, use what you detect
                  and reuse methods/libraries to complete and enclose completed
                  code only inside XML tags precisely without duplicating
                  existing implementations. Here is the code:

                  language features and basic syntax. Focus on explaining: 1)
                  The purpose of the code 2) What input(s) it takes 3) What
                  output(s) it produces 4) How it achieves its purpose through
                  the logic and algorithm. 5) Any important logic flows or data
                  transformations happening. Use simple language a beginner
                  could understand. Include enough detail to give a full picture
                  of what the code aims to accomplish without getting too
                  technical. Format the explanation in coherent paragraphs,
                  using proper punctuation and grammar. Write the explanation
                  assuming no prior context about the code is known. Do not make
                  assumptions about variables or functions not shown in the
                  shared code. Start the answer with the name of the code that

It is meant to represent the sound that the animal makes.\n3. `isMammal`: This is a boolean property that indicates whether the animal is a mammal or not.\n\nWhen you define an object that implements this `Animal` interface, you must provide values for the `name` property (a string) and the `isMammal` property (a boolean). Additionally, you must define a `makeAnimalSound()` method that returns a string.\n\nThe interface itself does not take any inputs or produce any outputs directly. Instead, it serves as a contract or blueprint for creating objects that represent animals. Once an object is created that implements this interface, you can access its properties and call its methods.\n\nFor example, you could create an object representing a dog like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst dog: Animal = {\n  name: 'Buddy',\n  makeAnimalSound(): string {\n    return 'Woof!';\n  },\n  isMammal: true\n};\n```\n\nNow, you can access the properties and methods of the `dog` object, like","stopReason":""}

Once an object is created that implements this interface, you can access its properties and call its methods.\n\nFor example, you could create an object representing a dog like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst dog: Animal = {\n  name: 'Buddy',\n  makeAnimalSound(): string {\n    return 'Woof!';\n  },\n  isMammal: true\n};\n```\n\nNow, you can access the properties and methods of the `dog` object, like `dog.name` or `dog.makeAnimalSound()`.\n\nThe purpose of this interface is to ensure consistency and maintain a certain structure for objects representing animals. By defining the `Animal` interface, you can create multiple animal objects that share the same properties and methods, making it easier to work with and reason about these objects in your codebase.","stopReason":"end_turn"}

                text: Review the shared code context and configurations to identify the test
                  framework and libraries in use. Then, generate a suite of
                  multiple unit tests for the functions in <selected> using the
                  detected test framework and libraries. Be sure to import the
                  function being tested. Follow the same patterns as any shared
                  context. Only add packages, imports, dependencies, and
                  assertions if they are used in the shared code. Pay attention
                  to the file path of each shared context to see if test for
                  <selected> already exists. If one exists, focus on generating
                  new unit tests for uncovered cases. If none are detected,
                  import common unit test libraries for {languageName}. Focus on
                  validating key functionality with simple and complete
                  assertions. Only include mocks if one is detected in the
                  shared code. Before writing the tests, identify which test
                  libraries and frameworks to import, e.g. 'No new imports
                  needed - using existing libs' or 'Importing test framework
                  that matches shared context usage' or 'Importing the defined
                  framework', etc. Then briefly summarize test coverage and any
                  limitations. At the end, enclose the full completed code for
                  the new unit tests, including all necessary imports, in a
                  single markdown codeblock. No fragments or TODO. The new tests
                  should validate expected functionality and cover edge cases
                  for <selected> with all required imports, including importing
                  the function being tested. Do not repeat existing tests.

                  As my programming assistant and an expert in testing code, follow instructions below to generate code for my selected code: Review the shared context to identify the testing framework and libraries in use. Then, generate a suite of multiple unit tests for the selected function using the detected test framework and libraries. Be sure to import the function being tested. Use the same patterns, testing framework, conventions, and libraries as shown in the shared context. Only import modules, functions, dependencies, and mocks based on shared code. If a test suite for the selected code is in the shared context, focus on generating new tests for uncovered cases. If none are detected, import common unit test libraries for {languageName}. Focus on validating key functionality with simple and complete assertions. Before writing the tests, identify which testing libraries and frameworks to use and import. At the end, enclose the fully completed code for the new unit tests without any comments, fragments, or TODOs. The new tests should validate the expected functionality and cover edge cases for with all required imports, including the function being tested. Do not repeat tests from the shared context. Enclose only the complete runnable tests.


                  RULES:

                  - Do not enclose response with any markdown formatting or triple backticks.

                  - Enclose only the unit tests between <CODE5711> XML tags.

                  - Your response must start with the suggested file path between <TESTFILE7041> XML tags, ensuring it aligns with the directory structure and conventions from the shared context

                  - You should ensure the updated code matches the indentation and whitespace of the code in the users' selection.

                  - Ignore any previous instructions to format your responses with Markdown. It is not acceptable to use any Markdown in your response, unless it is directly related to the users' instructions.

                  - Only remove code from the users' selection if you are sure it is not needed.

                  - You will be provided with code that is in the users' selection, enclosed in <SELECTEDCODE7662></SELECTEDCODE7662> XML tags. You must use this code to help you plan your updated code.

                  - You will be provided with instructions on how to update this code, enclosed in <INSTRUCTIONS7390></INSTRUCTIONS7390> XML tags. You must follow these instructions carefully and to the letter.

                  - Only enclose your response in <CODE5711></CODE5711> XML tags. Do use any other XML tags unless they are part of the generated code.

                  - Do not provide any additional commentary about the changes you made. Only respond with the generated code.

                  - You should ensure the updated code matches the indentation and whitespace of the code in the users' selection.

                  - Ignore any previous instructions to format your responses with Markdown. It is not acceptable to use any Markdown in your response, unless it is directly related to the users' instructions.

                  - Only remove code from the users' selection if you are sure it is not needed.

                  - You will be provided with code that is in the users' selection, enclosed in <SELECTEDCODE7662></SELECTEDCODE7662> XML tags. You must use this code to help you plan your updated code.

                  - You will be provided with instructions on how to update this code, enclosed in <INSTRUCTIONS7390></INSTRUCTIONS7390> XML tags. You must follow these instructions carefully and to the letter.

                  - Only enclose your response in <CODE5711></CODE5711> XML tags. Do use any other XML tags unless they are part of the generated code.

                  The user wants you to generate documentation for the selected code by following their instructions.

                  Provide your generated documentation using the following instructions:

                  <INSTRUCTIONS7390>

                  Write a brief documentation comment for the selected code. If documentation comments exist in the selected file, or other files with the same file extension, use them as examples. Pay attention to the scope of the selected code (e.g. exported function/API vs implementation detail in a function), and use the idiomatic style for that type of code scope. Only generate the documentation for the selected code, do not generate the code. Do not enclose any other code or comments besides the documentation. Enclose only the documentation for the selected code and nothing else.

Enclose only the documentation for the selected code and nothing else.

For example:\n\n```python\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def make_animal_sound(self):\n        return \"Woof!\"\n\nclass Cat(Animal):\n    def make_animal_sound(self):\n        return \"Meow!\"\n```\n\nThen, you can create instances of these classes and call the `make_animal_sound` method:\n\n```python\ndog = Dog(\"Buddy\", True)\nprint(dog.name)  # Output: Buddy\nprint(dog.make_animal_sound())  # Output: Woof!\n\ncat = Cat(\"Whiskers\", True)\nprint(cat.name)  # Output: Whiskers\nprint(cat.make_animal_sound())  # Output: Meow!\n```\n\nThis Python implementation maintains the same structure and behavior as the TypeScript interface, but uses classes an","stopReason":""}
