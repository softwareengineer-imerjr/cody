# Cody standalone web app

The `@sourcegraph/cody-web` package implements a standalone web app for Cody for development purposes only.

To run this standalone web app: `pnpm dev`, then open http://localhost:5777 and enter a Sourcegraph.com access token.

**Status:** experimental (for development purposes only, not an end-user product)

For now, it is OK to break this web app when making other changes to Cody if it seems hard to support.
